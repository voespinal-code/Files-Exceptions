# Description:
#   This script reads the content of a text file containing phrases about Python,
#   replaces all occurrences of the word 'Python' with 'C', and prints the result
#   in two different formats: full content and recomposed from lines.

# Define the path to the source file

# Read the file's contents

# Replace all occurrences of 'Python' with 'C'

# Print the modified content directly
